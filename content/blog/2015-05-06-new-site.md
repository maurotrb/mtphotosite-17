Today I published my new site.

The previous one was hosted on [SmugMug](https://www.smugmug.com/), and I was very happy with it.
But the cost of Power plan, necessary to use my own domain, was not justified for an amateur photographer like me.
Moreover I took the opportunity to merge my portfolio site with my blog that were a self-hosted Wordpress blog.

If you are technically savvy, and you want more information on how I created this site, you can read the [techical about](/technical-about/).
