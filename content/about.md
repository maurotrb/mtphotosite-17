### About me

I'm Mauro Taraborelli, an amateur photographer based in [Senigallia](https://www.google.it/maps/place/60019+Senigallia,+Province+of+Ancona), a small coastal town in central Italy. My interest in photography grew naturally from the surroundings: within a short distance, you can move from the sea to historic towns and gentle hills.

Through photography, I try to document these places and the people who live here in a simple and direct way.

If youâ€™re interested in my work or would like more information, fell free to get in touch by [e-mail](mailto:mauro@taraborelliphoto.com).
