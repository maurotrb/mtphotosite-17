### My profile

I'm Mauro Taraborelli, and I'm an amateur photographer living in [Senigallia](https://www.google.it/maps/place/60019+Senigallia,+Province+of+Ancona), a small sea town in central Italy. The interest for the surroundings where I live foster my passion for photography. In minutes, you can pass from seaside, to cities of historic interest and to lovely hills. It seemed natural to me to try to depict these views and the people who live here at their best.

If you are interested in my photos and you want more information, you can contact me by [e-mail](mailto:mauro@taraborelliphoto.com).
