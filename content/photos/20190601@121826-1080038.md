title = "The Lame Rosse Canyon"
description = "In the region of Le Marche, these odd rock formations were formed due to millions of years of erosion. The result of this natural process of eroding the calcareous layer away is that it exposed the clay rock beneath rich in iron oxide and hence, the red hue. Lame Rosse in Italian literally means 'red blades'."
