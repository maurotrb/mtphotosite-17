description = "Portici Ercolani reflected in Misa river at night. Portici Ercolani (Ercolani's Arcades) are sequence of 126 arches of Istria stone along the right bank of Misa river in Senigallia, Ancona, Italy. They owe their name to Monsignor Giuseppe Ercolani (1677-1759) who designed them in the mid-eighteenth century to house the many merchants who arrived in town in July, for the famous trade fair named after St. Mary Magdalene."
