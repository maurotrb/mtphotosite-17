description = "The gondola is a traditional flat-bottomed Venetian boat, designed for the shallow waters of the lagoon. Rowed by a gondolier with a single oar, it is built asymmetrically for efficient movement. Once the main transport in Venice, gondolas today are used mostly for tourism and short ferry crossings over the Grand Canal."
