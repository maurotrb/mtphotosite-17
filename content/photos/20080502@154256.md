description = "Sightseeing in Isola Bella, Lake Maggiore. Lake Maggiore, a long, thin lake on the south side of the Alps, is noted for its picturesque setting amid greenery-covered mountains. It’s shared by Italy’s Piedmont and Lombardy regions and Switzerland’s Ticino canton. Within it are the 3 tiny Borromean Islands, known for terraced gardens and aristocratic villas. They're reachable by boat from Stresa, one of the larger lake towns, in Piedmont. Isola Bella is one of the Borromean Islands of Lago Maggiore in north Italy. The island is situated in the Borromean Gulf 400 metres from the lakeside town of Stresa."
